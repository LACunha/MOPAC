You can compile and install this package using commands

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

In installation only the libmopac library is installed, not the standalone
mopac7 executable which is also generated in the compilation stage.

You can use the run_mopac7 script to start the standalone mopac7 application,
for example to run some of the test files:

	./run_mopac7 tests/force

20051011 ; the mopac7 package should now be gcc-4 compliant, but if you still
wish to use an older compiler, you need to do the following:

        CC=gcc-3.2 ./configure

This makes sure that gcc-3 compiler is used.

20051106: If building on Mac OS X or Darwin, Geoff Hutchison recommends
using Fink and:

CFLAGS="-I/sw/include -fno-common" LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib -Wl,-undefined \
-Wl,dynamic_lookup -Wl,-m -Wl,bind_at_load" ./configure
